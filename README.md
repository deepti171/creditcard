 Our goal is to predict a binary outcome of 1, to indicate safe driver, or 0, to indicate that if the customer is fraud or not . We will also look at the continuous variables and fill in the missing data with the mean or median in order to not skew our results. After cleaning up the data and filling in missing data we will look at the features and their correlation so that we can drop highly correlated data which may impact our results.
